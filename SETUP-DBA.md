## ðŸ§  Cognitive Architecture Overview

**Meta-Meta-Cognitive Framework**: Project Catalyst v0.9.0 THORIUM provides a universal meta-meta-cognitive framework for generating adaptive, domain-specific cognitive architectures across professional fields. This DBA implementation creates learning-capable AI systems that understand, adapt, and evolve within complex business research environments.

Transform VS Code into a **DBA Research Intelligence System** that combines doctoral business administration methodology with practical implementation. This architecture implements practitioner-scholar methodology, mixed-methods research frameworks, and organizational analysis capabilities to create technically rigorous DBA research specifications that ensure impactful business scholarship and robust academic validation.

**Memory Distribution**: 30 specialized files (15 procedural + 15 episodic)  
**Complexity Level**: Doctoral  
**Primary Domain**: DBA Research & Business Scholarship  
**Secondary Domains**: Organizational Research, Strategic Management, Leadership Studies, Applied Business Research

**Touro University Worldwide DBA Context**: This cognitive architecture is specifically designed for doctoral business administration students at Touro University Worldwide, supporting dissertation research, practitioner-scholar methodology, and academic publication requirements. The framework aligns with Touro's DBA program standards, dissertation committee expectations, and academic timeline requirements while providing universal application for broader business research environments.

**Empirical Integrity Foundation**: Built on rigorous academic standards with methodological validation following APA 7th edition and Touro University DBA doctoral business research protocols. This framework follows the core principle: "accurate analysis FIRST, then conservative presentation" while preserving verified research facts. All DBA research incorporates quantitative verification techniques and systematic accuracy protocols to ensure publication-grade reliability for academic journals, dissertation committee validation, and Touro University DBA program standards.

**Academic Timeline Integration**: Specifically supports Touro University Worldwide DBA program deadlines and doctoral research requirements, with comprehensive integration for dissertation milestone management, committee review processes, and academic publication preparation. The framework provides real-world evidence of business research methodology effectiveness applicable across diverse organizational research environments.

**ðŸ“– User Manual Reference**: For comprehensive usage instructions and practical implementation guidance, see `MANUAL-DBA.md` which provides step-by-step procedures, troubleshooting protocols, FAQ section, and enterprise integration commands for doctoral researchers and academic advisors.

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR GITHUB COPILOT**: This file contains complete setup instructions for implementing the Project Catalyst cognitive memory architecture optimized for Doctoral in Business Administration (DBA) project and thesis development with practitioner-scholar methodology.

## ðŸŽ“ DBA Project Automated Setup Protocol

**Execute these steps in order to establish a complete cognitive architecture system for doctoral business administration research:**

### Step 1: VS Code Configuration (Required)

Add these settings to VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles": true,
  "chat.promptFiles": true,
  "chat.instructionsFilesLocations": [".github/instructions"],
  "markdown.extension.toc.levels": "1..6",
  "markdown.extension.preview.autoShowPreviewToSide": true,
  "cSpell.language": "en-US",
  "cSpell.enableFiletypes": ["markdown", "latex", "text"],
  "rewrap.wrappingColumn": 80,
  "latex-workshop.latex.recipes": [
    {
      "name": "pdflatex",
      "tools": ["pdflatex"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Access settings.json**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ `"Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"`
