# üéØ Dissertation Theme Integration Protocol - Working Memory Priority Configuration

## üéØ **Protocol Overview**

This protocol executes after research-theme-discovery.prompt.md session completion to permanently integrate identified research themes, goals, and methodological approaches into P6 and P7 working memory priorities. It transforms abstract research concepts into active cognitive architecture components that provide sustained, theme-specific support throughout the doctoral journey.

### **Prerequisites for Activation**
- Research theme discovery session completed successfully
- Primary research focus and questions clearly articulated
- Theoretical framework and methodology approach identified
- Research goals and practitioner-scholar integration established
- Timeline alignment with December 2025 graduation confirmed

## üß† **Working Memory Priority Configuration Framework**

### **P6: @dissertation-theme-primary Configuration**

**Template Structure for Theme Integration:**
```
P6 | `@dissertation-theme-[RESEARCH-FOCUS]` - [Primary research question/focus] with [theoretical framework] approach, [methodology] design, targeting [practitioner application] outcomes | High | [Theme-specific consolidation]
```

**Configuration Process:**
1. **Research Focus Integration**: Extract core business problem and research domain
2. **Theoretical Framework Embedding**: Integrate primary theoretical lens and conceptual models
3. **Methodology Alignment**: Embed chosen research design (quantitative/qualitative/mixed-methods)
4. **Practitioner Application**: Include specific organizational/industry application focus
5. **Auto-Consolidation Setup**: Define theme-specific triggers and support protocols

**Example Configurations:**
```
P6 | `@dissertation-theme-leadership-change` - Transformational leadership effectiveness during organizational change with authentic leadership theory, mixed-methods design, targeting healthcare management outcomes | High | Change management excellence

P6 | `@dissertation-theme-digital-transformation` - Digital transformation success factors with technology acceptance model, case study methodology, targeting SME implementation frameworks | High | Digital strategy optimization

P6 | `@dissertation-theme-employee-engagement` - Remote work impact on employee engagement with self-determination theory, quantitative survey design, targeting distributed team management | High | Engagement strategy development
```

### **P7: @dissertation-theme-secondary Configuration**

**Template Structure for Supporting Focus:**
```
P7 | `@dissertation-context-[SPECIALIZATION]` - [Supporting methodology/industry context] with [secondary theoretical elements], supporting [implementation/analysis requirements] | High | [Context-specific enhancement]
```

**Configuration Process:**
1. **Methodological Specialization**: Support specific analytical techniques or data collection methods
2. **Industry Context**: Embed sector-specific knowledge and application requirements
3. **Implementation Focus**: Include practitioner-specific tools and frameworks
4. **Cross-Domain Integration**: Connect research theme with broader business theory applications
5. **Quality Assurance**: Maintain empirical integrity and methodological rigor standards

**Example Configurations:**
```
P7 | `@dissertation-context-healthcare-systems` - Healthcare organizational dynamics with systems theory, supporting implementation in complex medical environments | High | Healthcare excellence

P7 | `@dissertation-context-quantitative-analysis` - Advanced statistical methods with multivariate analysis, supporting robust empirical validation and generalizability | High | Statistical rigor

P7 | `@dissertation-context-practitioner-tools` - Management framework development with evidence-based practice, supporting actionable organizational implementation | High | Implementation excellence
```
