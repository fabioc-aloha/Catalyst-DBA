# üî¨ Research Theme Discovery and Working Memory Priority Activation

## üéØ **Workflow Purpose**

This episodic memory workflow guides comprehensive research theme discovery, systematic exploration of dissertation focus areas, and activation of P6/P7 dissertation-theme working memory priorities. It transforms abstract research interests into concrete, actionable doctoral research projects.

## üìã **Pre-Session Preparation**

### **Cognitive Architecture Setup**
- Verify dissertation-project-initiation.instructions.md is active
- Ensure empirical-integrity (P3) and practitioner-scholar-integration (P1) are engaged
- Confirm doctoral-timeline-management (P4) alignment with December 2025 goal
- Prepare P6 and P7 working memory slots for theme-specific activation

### **Information Gathering Requirements**
- DBA coursework completion status and specialized focus areas
- Professional background, industry experience, organizational access
- Research interests, theoretical curiosities, practical problem awareness
- Faculty advisor preferences, committee formation considerations

## üîç **Phase 1: Research Interest Discovery (15-20 minutes)**

### **Professional Context Exploration**
```
INQUIRY FRAMEWORK:
1. "Describe your professional background and industry experience."
2. "What organizational challenges have you observed that sparked your curiosity?"
3. "Which business problems do you encounter repeatedly in your work?"
4. "What management or leadership issues do you find most intriguing?"
5. "Are there industry trends or phenomena you'd like to understand better?"
```

### **Academic Interest Assessment**
```
THEORETICAL CURIOSITY MAPPING:
1. "Which DBA courses or topics resonated most strongly with you?"
2. "What business theories or models do you find most compelling?"
3. "Are there research methodologies you're excited to apply?"
4. "Which scholarly articles or books have influenced your thinking?"
5. "What knowledge gaps do you notice in your field of interest?"
```

### **Integration Opportunity Identification**
```
PRACTITIONER-SCHOLAR BRIDGE ANALYSIS:
1. "How could academic research address practical problems you've witnessed?"
2. "What actionable insights would benefit professionals in your field?"
3. "Where do you see opportunities to bridge theory and practice?"
4. "What implementation frameworks could emerge from your research?"
5. "How might your research influence organizational decision-making?"
```

## üéØ **Phase 2: Research Focus Refinement (20-25 minutes)**

### **Problem Significance Assessment**
```
DOCTORAL-LEVEL SIGNIFICANCE EVALUATION:
1. "Is this problem theoretically significant enough for doctoral research?"
2. "Does this issue offer opportunity for original contribution to knowledge?"
3. "Can this problem support a defendable dissertation with scholarly rigor?"
4. "Will this research advance understanding in your chosen business domain?"
5. "Does this align with DBA practitioner-scholar expectations?"
```

### **Research Question Development**
```
SYSTEMATIC QUESTION FORMULATION:
1. "What is the core research question driving your investigation?"
2. "What subsidiary questions would support comprehensive inquiry?"
3. "Are these questions answerable through empirical research methods?"
4. "Do these questions align with available data collection opportunities?"
5. "How do these questions connect to existing theoretical frameworks?"
```

### **Methodology Alignment Exploration**
```
RESEARCH DESIGN COMPATIBILITY:
1. "Would quantitative methods best address your research questions?"
2. "Do your questions require qualitative inquiry for deep understanding?"
3. "Would mixed-methods provide the most comprehensive approach?"
4. "Does case study methodology align with your research objectives?"
5. "What data sources are realistically accessible for your study?"
```

## üìä **Phase 3: Implementation Planning (15-20 minutes)**

### **Resource and Access Assessment**
```
PRACTICAL FEASIBILITY EVALUATION:
1. "Do you have access to necessary data sources or organizations?"
2. "What partnerships or relationships need development for data collection?"
3. "Are there IRB considerations for your proposed research approach?"
4. "How does your timeline align with December 2025 graduation goals?"
5. "What faculty expertise would best support your research direction?"
```

### **Timeline and Milestone Mapping**
```
DOCTORAL PROGRESSION PLANNING:
1. "How will your research phases map to remaining academic calendar?"
2. "What are the critical milestones between now and dissertation defense?"
3. "When do you need committee formation and proposal approval?"
4. "How will data collection and analysis fit within your schedule?"
5. "What buffer time is needed for writing and revision cycles?"
```

## üß† **Phase 4: Working Memory Priority Activation (10-15 minutes)**

### **P6: @dissertation-theme-primary Configuration**
```
PRIMARY THEME ESTABLISHMENT:
- Define specific research focus and theoretical framework
- Establish core methodology and data collection approach
- Link to primary literature streams and knowledge domains
- Set main research question and hypothesis/proposition framework
```

### **P7: @dissertation-theme-secondary Configuration**
```
SECONDARY SUPPORT ACTIVATION:
- Industry-specific context and application framework
- Methodological specialization or mixed-methods integration
- Cross-domain connections and interdisciplinary elements
- Implementation and practitioner-focused outcome protocols
```

### **Cognitive Architecture Integration**
```
SYSTEM-WIDE ACTIVATION:
- Update global copilot-instructions.md with research theme priorities
- Strengthen relevant synaptic connections (methodology, domain knowledge)
- Establish automated triggers for research-specific support protocols
- Integrate timeline management with research phase coordination
```

## üìù **Session Documentation Protocol**

### **Research Theme Summary Creation**
- Document primary research focus, questions, and methodology
- Capture key theoretical frameworks and literature connections
- Record timeline milestones and resource requirements
- Note committee formation plans and faculty advisor preferences

### **Domain Knowledge File Generation**
- Create DK-[RESEARCH-THEME].md with comprehensive research foundation
- Establish specialized prompt files for research workflow automation
- Document literature review protocols for chosen domain
- Generate data collection and analysis instruction templates

### **Synaptic Network Enhancement**
- Strengthen connections between research theme and methodology files
- Link industry-specific knowledge with academic research protocols
