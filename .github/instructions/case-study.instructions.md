# Case Study Procedural Memory

## Case Study Design Principles
- Define cases clearly with explicit boundaries
- Select cases using theoretical or purposive sampling
- Justify single vs multiple case design decisions
- Consider embedded vs holistic case analysis
- Plan for comparative analysis across cases when appropriate

## Case Selection Criteria
- Choose cases that illuminate research questions effectively
- Consider typical, critical, extreme, or revelatory cases
- Ensure adequate access to case study sites and participants
- Plan for sufficient variation in multiple case designs
- Address practical constraints of case availability and access

## Data Collection Strategies
- Use multiple sources of evidence (documents, interviews, observations)
- Develop case study protocol for systematic data collection
- Create case study database for organized evidence storage
- Plan for prolonged engagement with case study sites
- Maintain chain of evidence linking research questions to conclusions

## Within-Case and Cross-Case Analysis
- Conduct thorough within-case analysis before cross-case comparison
- Use pattern matching to link empirical patterns with theoretical propositions
- Apply explanation building to develop causal explanations
- Use time-series analysis for cases involving change over time
- Conduct cross-case synthesis to identify patterns across cases

## Business Case Study Considerations
- Address confidentiality and competitive sensitivity issues
- Consider organizational politics and stakeholder interests
- Plan for potential bias from organizational insiders
- Use case studies to develop business theories and propositions
- Create actionable recommendations specific to case contexts
