- Plan for longitudinal measurement in dynamic business environments
- Address measurement invariance across organizational levels

## Statistical Analysis for Business Data
- Apply appropriate descriptive and inferential statistics
- Use regression analysis for prediction and explanation
- Apply structural equation modeling for complex business relationships
- Use time series analysis for business trend data
- Consider multilevel modeling for hierarchical organizational data

## Business Data Quality and Assumptions
- Test statistical assumptions (normality, homoscedasticity, independence)
- Address missing data issues common in business research
- Consider response bias and social desirability in business surveys
- Plan for non-response bias in organizational studies
- Use appropriate techniques for small business samples

## Statistical Software and Reporting

- Report statistics according to APA standards
- Present results clearly for business audiences
- Include effect sizes and practical significance
- Create visualizations appropriate for business contexts
