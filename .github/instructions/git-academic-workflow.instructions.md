git commit -m "üìù WRITING: Prepare chapters 1-2 for committee review

Committee Focus: Theoretical framework and literature review
Review Timeline: 2-week feedback cycle
Next Steps: Incorporate feedback and proceed to methodology"

# Tag for committee milestones
git tag -a "Committee-Review-1" -m "First formal committee review - Chapters 1-2"
```

#### IRB Compliance Workflow
```bash
# Document IRB preparation
git add irb-templates/ methodology/ethics/
git commit -m "üî¨ METHOD: Prepare IRB submission materials

Ethics Protocol: Complete human subjects research framework
Consent Forms: Finalize participant consent documentation  
Data Security: Implement HIPAA-compliant data protection
IRB Timeline: Submit by [DATE] for [SEMESTER] data collection"

# Tag IRB milestones
git tag -a "IRB-Submission" -m "IRB application submitted - awaiting approval"
git tag -a "IRB-Approved" -m "IRB approval received - data collection authorized"
```

#### Milestone and Defense Preparation
```bash
# Track major milestones
git milestone  # View completed milestones
git timeline   # Visual progress review

# Defense preparation
git add defense-materials/
git commit -m "‚úÖ COMPLETE: Doctoral defense preparation materials

Dissertation: Final version submitted to committee
Presentation: 45-minute defense presentation completed
Research Contribution: Original contribution to business knowledge validated
Defense Date: [DATE] at [TIME]"

git tag -a "Defense-Ready" -m "Doctoral defense preparation complete"
```

### Repository Organization for Academic Excellence

#### Branch Strategy for Doctoral Research
```bash
# Main research development
main              # Stable, committee-approved versions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ literature-review    # Literature development branch
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ methodology-design   # Research design refinement
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data-collection     # Data gathering phase
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis-phase      # Data analysis and findings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ writing-chapters    # Dissertation writing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ committee-feedback  # Incorporating advisor feedback
```

#### Academic Tagging Convention
```bash
# Proposal milestones
git tag -a "Proposal-Draft-1" -m "Initial research proposal draft"
git tag -a "Proposal-Defense" -m "Research proposal successfully defended"

# Research milestones  
git tag -a "IRB-Approved" -m "IRB approval - data collection authorized"
git tag -a "Data-Collection-Complete" -m "All participant data collected"
git tag -a "Analysis-Complete" -m "Data analysis and findings finalized"

### Integration with DBA Cognitive Architecture

#### Automatic Memory Consolidation
```bash
# When meditation command triggers consolidation
git add .github/
git commit -m "üß† COGNITIVE: Consolidate DBA cognitive architecture learnings

Memory Optimization: Update procedural and episodic memory systems
Research Integration: Incorporate new academic workflow patterns
Performance Enhancement: Improve research efficiency and quality"
```

#### Research Progress Documentation
```bash
# Daily research logging
git log --oneline --since="1 week ago" --grep="üìã RESEARCH"  # Research activities
git log --oneline --since="1 month ago" --grep="üìù WRITING"  # Writing progress
git log --oneline --since="3 months ago" --grep="‚úÖ COMPLETE" # Major milestones
```

### Best Practices for Doctoral Research Git Workflow

1. **Daily Commits**: Document daily research progress
2. **Descriptive Messages**: Use academic categories and detailed descriptions  
3. **Branch Protection**: Use branches for major research phases
4. **Milestone Tagging**: Mark important academic achievements
5. **Committee Collaboration**: Separate branches for advisor feedback
6. **IRB Compliance**: Protect sensitive data through .gitignore
7. **Timeline Visualization**: Regular use of `git timeline` for progress review
8. **Academic Integrity**: Transparent history supports scholarly rigor

### Emergency Recovery Procedures
```bash
# Backup before major changes
git checkout -b backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)

# Recover lost work
git reflog  # Find lost commits
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>  # Recover specific changes

# Committee feedback incorporation
git stash  # Save current work
git checkout committee-feedback
git merge main  # Integrate latest changes
git stash pop  # Restore work in progress
```

This Git workflow integration ensures that version control becomes an integral part of the DBA research process, supporting academic excellence while maintaining the highest standards of scholarly integrity and research compliance.
