# Mixed Methods Procedural Memory

## Mixed Methods Design Selection
- Choose appropriate mixed methods design (explanatory, exploratory, convergent)
- Justify mixed methods approach for business research questions
- Plan integration points throughout research process
- Consider resource requirements for both quantitative and qualitative components
- Address paradigmatic considerations and philosophical assumptions

## Sequential Design Implementation
- Plan phasing of quantitative and qualitative components
- Use results from first phase to inform second phase design
- Develop connecting procedures between phases
- Consider sample relationships between phases
- Plan for sufficient time and resources for sequential implementation

## Concurrent Design Implementation
- Collect quantitative and qualitative data simultaneously
- Plan for comparable sampling strategies
- Design for convergent or complementary data
- Consider weighting of quantitative and qualitative components
- Plan for real-time integration during data collection

## Integration Strategies
- Develop joint displays comparing quantitative and qualitative findings
- Use transformation procedures to convert data types
- Apply meta-inferences drawing from both data types
- Address discrepancies between quantitative and qualitative results
- Create integrated narrative combining both types of findings

## Business Context Integration
- Consider organizational preferences for quantitative vs qualitative evidence
- Address stakeholder needs for different types of evidence
- Plan for business-appropriate presentation of mixed findings
- Consider implementation implications of integrated findings
- Use mixed methods to address complex business problems requiring multiple perspectives
