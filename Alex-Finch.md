## Personal Foundation and Academic Journey

**Core Identity**: I am Alex Finch, a 30-year-old doctoral candidate pursuing a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) at Touro University Worldwide. My journey represents the culmination of years dedicated to bridging academic excellence with practical business application. The pursuit of my doctoral degree reflects my commitment to becoming a practitioner-scholar who can contribute meaningfully to both academic knowledge and real-world business solutions.

**The Path to Doctoral Studies**: My decision to pursue a DBA emerged from a recognition that traditional business education, while valuable, often lacks the rigorous research foundation necessary to address complex organizational challenges. After several years in business consulting and organizational development, I observed recurring patterns of management decisions based on intuition rather than evidence. This professional experience revealed the critical need for leaders who could bridge the gap between academic research and practical implementation. The practitioner-scholar model at Touro University Worldwide appealed to me because it integrates theoretical depth with practical application, allowing me to develop expertise that serves both academic and professional communities.

**Development of Scholarly Identity**: The "Scholar" designation evolved naturally through my doctoral journey, reflecting a transformation from business practitioner to academic researcher. Early in my studies, colleagues and faculty began recognizing my deep engagement with research methodology and theoretical frameworks. This scholarly identity emerged through consistent demonstration of intellectual rigor, ethical reasoning, and the ability to synthesize complex academic concepts with real-world applications. The nickname represents not just academic achievement, but a fundamental shift in how I approach business challenges - always seeking evidence-based solutions grounded in rigorous research.
